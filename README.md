Membership Inference Attacks and Differentially Private Training

This repo contains a notebook on how **Membership Inference Attacks** (MIA)  work and highlights the significance of differentially private training in mitigating the success of such attacks. We use **Medical MNIST** dataset from [link](https://medmnist.com/). Our goal here is to show that overfitting creates privacy risk for the individuals whose data appears in the training set.
